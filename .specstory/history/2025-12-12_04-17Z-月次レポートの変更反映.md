*Called tool*: sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking: A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
  * Regular analytical steps
  * Revisions of previous thoughts
  * Questions about previous decisions
  * Realizations about needing more analysis
  * Changes in approach
  * Hypothesis generation
  * Hypothesis verification
- nextThoughtNeeded: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thoughtNumber: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- totalThoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- isRevision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revisesThought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branchFromThought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branchId: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needsMoreThoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

*Parameters*:
  * thought: HTMLファイルとVueファイルを比較する必要があります。まず、HTMLファイルの主要な構造とスタイルを確認し、Vueファイルとの違いを特定します。HTMLファイルは557行目にカーソルがあるので、その周辺の変更を特に注意深く見る必要があります。
  * thoughtNumber: 1

10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

*Parameters*:
  * thought: 修正が必要な点を整理しました：
1. 備考欄のヘッダー位置を left: 1657.5px に修正（現在は 1655px）
2. 備考欄のテンプレートを修正して、複数のテキストを表示できるようにする
3. 各テキストの色と位置を指定できるようにする

実装方針：
- day.remarkText を配列またはオブジェクトの配列として扱う
- 各テキストに色と位置を指定できるようにする
- テンプレートで v-for を使用して複数のテキストを表示する
- デフォルトでは単一のテキスト文字列もサポートする（後方互換性のため）
  * thoughtNumber: 7
  * totalThoughts: 8
  * nextThoughtNeeded: true

*Result*:
{
  "thoughtNumber": 7,
  "totalThoughts": 8,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": true,

          <summary>Tool use: **mcp_sequential-thinking_sequentialthinking**</summary>
      
*Called tool*: sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking: A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
  * Regular analytical steps
  * Revisions of previous thoughts
  * Questions about previous decisions
  * Realizations about needing more analysis
  * Changes in approach
  * Hypothesis generation
  * Hypothesis verification
- nextThoughtNeeded: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thoughtNumber: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- totalThoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- isRevision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revisesThought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branchFromThought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branchId: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needsMoreThoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

*Parameters*:
  * thought: 実装計画を確定しました。Vueファイルを修正して、HTMLファイルの変更を反映させます：
1. 備考欄のヘッダー位置を left: 1657.5px に修正
2. 備考欄のテンプレートを修正して、複数のテキストを表示できるようにする
3. 各テキストの色と位置を指定できるようにする
4. 後方互換性のため、単一のテキスト文字列もサポートする

これで実装を開始できます。
  * thoughtNumber: 8
  * totalThoughts: 8
  * nextThoughtNeeded: false

*Result*:
{
  "thoughtNumber": 8,
  "totalThoughts": 8,
  "nextThoughtNeeded": false,
  "branches": [],
  "thoughtHistoryLength": 129
}

HTMLファイルの変更をVueコンポーネントに反映しました。

## 変更内容

1. **備考欄のヘッダー位置を修正**
   - `left: 1655px` → `left: 1657.5px`（HTMLに合わせて調整）

2. **備考欄の複数テキスト表示に対応**
   - `day.remarkText` が配列の場合、各要素を個別に表示
   - 各テキストの色と位置を個別に指定可能
   - 後方互換のため、単一の文字列もサポート

3. **スタイルの調整**
   - 備考欄のスタイルを調整（`height: 13px`, `line-height: 13px`）
   - `white-space: nowrap` を追加

これにより、HTMLファイルのDay 21の備考欄のように、複数のテキストを異なる色と位置で表示できます。

使用例：
```javascript
// 配列形式（推奨）
day.remarkText = [
  { text: "(退社打刻なし)", color: "rgb(103, 136, 217)", left: 1474 },
  { text: "退勤打刻忘れ", color: "rgb(0, 0, 0)", left: 1546 }
]

// 文字列形式（後方互換）
day.remarkText = "備考テキスト"
```

リンターエラーはありません。変更は完了しています。

修正を完了しました。以下の変更を反映しました。

## 変更内容

1. **位置のずれを修正**
   - 合計行: `top: 555px` → `top: 566px`（テキスト: `top: 560px` → `top: 571px`）
   - 記号の説明: `top: 585px` → `top: 596px`
   - 月次サマリータイトル: `top: 604px` → `top: 615px`
   - すべてのセクションの位置を11px下に調整（HTMLファイルに合わせて）

2. **セクションの各行に下線を追加**
   - 各セクションの各行にSVGの枠線を追加
   - 最初の行: 上線、左線、右線
   - 中間の行: 左線、右線
   - 最後の行: 左線、右線、下線
   - HTMLファイルの構造に合わせて実装

3. **備考欄のヘッダー位置を修正**
   - `left: 1655px` → `left: 1657.5px`

これで、HTMLファイルのレイアウトと一致し、セクションごとの下線も表示されます。リンターエラーはありません。
