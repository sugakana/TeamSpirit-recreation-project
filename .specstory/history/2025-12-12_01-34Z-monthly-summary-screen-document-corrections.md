*Called tool*: sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking: A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
  * Regular analytical steps
  * Revisions of previous thoughts
  * Questions about previous decisions
  * Realizations about needing more analysis
  * Changes in approach
  * Hypothesis generation
  * Hypothesis verification
- nextThoughtNeeded: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thoughtNumber: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- totalThoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- isRevision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revisesThought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branchFromThought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branchId: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needsMoreThoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

修正を完了しました。以下の変更を行いました：

## 修正内容

### 1. Section 6のNo重複を修正
- 89 → 93（遅刻回数・時間値）
- 90 → 94（早退回数・時間）
- 91 → 95（早退回数・時間値）
- 92 → 96（コア時間内の私用外出回数・時間）
- 93 → 97（コア時間内の私用外出回数・時間値）

### 2. 右カラム部分にSection 7を追加
- 「右カラム部分」→「右カラム部分 - Section 7」に変更
- 94 → 98（Section 7背景）
- 95 → 99（有給取得日数）
- 100と101は既に正しいため変更なし

### 3. 変更履歴を更新
- Section 6のNo重複修正とSection 7追加の記録を追加

これで、Noの重複が解消され、セクションごとの記載が統一されました。補足説明の「セクションごとの枠分けについて」と一致しています。

ではその内容で実装してください
UIは
@figma-plugin/figma-json-split/monthly-report/monthly-report-full.html を使用してください。
Sequential Thinking MCPを活用してください。

*Called tool*: sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking: A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
  * Regular analytical steps
  * Revisions of previous thoughts
  * Questions about previous decisions
  * Realizations about needing more analysis
  * Changes in approach
  * Hypothesis generation
  * Hypothesis verification
- nextThoughtNeeded: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thoughtNumber: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- totalThoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- isRevision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revisesThought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branchFromThought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branchId: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needsMoreThoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present
5. Mark thoughts that revise previous thinking or branch into new paths
6. Ignore information that is irrelevant to the current step
7. Generate a solution hypothesis when appropriate
8. Verify the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
9. Repeat the process until satisfied with the solution
10. Provide a single, ideally correct answer as the final output
11. Only set next_thought_needed to false when truly done and a satisfactory answer is reached

*Parameters*:
  * thought: 月次サマリー情報画面の実装を開始する。まず、現在のプロジェクト構造を確認し、既存のコンポーネントやビューの構造を理解する必要がある。HTMLファイルを参考に、Vue.jsコンポーネントとして実装する。

*Called tool*: sequential-thinking - sequentialthinking: A detailed tool for dynamic and reflective problem-solving through thoughts.
This tool helps analyze problems through a flexible thinking process that can adapt and evolve.
Each thought can build on, question, or revise previous insights as understanding deepens.

When to use this tool:
- Breaking down complex problems into steps
- Planning and design with room for revision
- Analysis that might need course correction
- Problems where the full scope might not be clear initially
- Problems that require a multi-step solution
- Tasks that need to maintain context over multiple steps
- Situations where irrelevant information needs to be filtered out

Key features:
- You can adjust total_thoughts up or down as you progress
- You can question or revise previous thoughts
- You can add more thoughts even after reaching what seemed like the end
- You can express uncertainty and explore alternative approaches
- Not every thought needs to build linearly - you can branch or backtrack
- Generates a solution hypothesis
- Verifies the hypothesis based on the Chain of Thought steps
- Repeats the process until satisfied
- Provides a correct answer

Parameters explained:
- thought: Your current thinking step, which can include:
  * Regular analytical steps
  * Revisions of previous thoughts
  * Questions about previous decisions
  * Realizations about needing more analysis
  * Changes in approach
  * Hypothesis generation
  * Hypothesis verification
- nextThoughtNeeded: True if you need more thinking, even if at what seemed like the end
- thoughtNumber: Current number in sequence (can go beyond initial total if needed)
- totalThoughts: Current estimate of thoughts needed (can be adjusted up/down)
- isRevision: A boolean indicating if this thought revises previous thinking
- revisesThought: If is_revision is true, which thought number is being reconsidered
- branchFromThought: If branching, which thought number is the branching point
- branchId: Identifier for the current branch (if any)
- needsMoreThoughts: If reaching end but realizing more thoughts needed

You should:
1. Start with an initial estimate of needed thoughts, but be ready to adjust
2. Feel free to question or revise previous thoughts
3. Don't hesitate to add more thoughts if needed, even at the "end"
4. Express uncertainty when present

月次サマリー情報画面の実装を完了しました。

## 実装内容

HTMLファイルのデザインに合わせて、`MonthlySummaryScreen.vue`を更新しました。

### 主な実装内容

1. **固定サイズレイアウト**
   - 1920x1080pxの固定コンテナ
   - absolute positioningで要素を配置

2. **ヘッダー部分**
   - プリンタへ出力ボタン（青色#0066CC）
   - 閉じるリンク
   - 情報ヘッダー（白背景、黒枠、複数列レイアウト）

3. **テーブル部分**
   - テーブルヘッダー（青色背景#6B9BC3）
   - テーブル行（交互の背景色：白と#F5F5F5）
   - 合計行（水色背景#E8F4F8）
   - 列幅をHTMLファイルの値に合わせて調整

4. **月次サマリーセクション**
   - **左カラム**: Section 1-3（所定出勤日数、所定労働時間、超過時間）
   - **中央カラム**: Section 4-6（法定労働時間、深夜労働時間、遅刻回数など）
   - **右カラム**: Section 7-10（有給取得日数、代休取得日数、無給休暇日数、有給残日数）
   - 各セクションは枠で囲まれ、交互に白とグレー背景

5. **データ表示機能**
   - 既存のAPI統合を維持
   - 時間フォーマット、日付フォーマット関数を実装
   - 過不足時間のマイナス表示（赤色）
   - 内訳の表示ロジック（データがない場合は「---」をグレー表示）

6. **その他の機能**
   - 印刷機能（window.print()）
   - ウィンドウ閉じる機能
   - ローディング表示
   - エラー表示

HTMLファイルのデザインを再現し、既存のデータ取得ロジックと統合しました。
